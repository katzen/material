# material

With the magic of angular and material design, move rectangles around a screen!

The materials behave according to the laws of material design, but with gravity added! Materials will fall down the z-axis (into the screen). Clicking them will make them bounce upwards. Use this bouncing to stack them.

The toolbar has buttons to delete all materials, change one's color, or display the computed z-axis location.

The only use I've found for this is *maybe* planning and laying out angular websites. Note however that if you want some material to appear at a certain z-axis height, you will have to stack others up below it as support!
